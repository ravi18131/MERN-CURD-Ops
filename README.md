# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

## Backend Setup

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the backend folder of the project using the `cd` command:
   
   cd Backend
   

3. Install the required Node.js packages using npm:
  
   npm install
   

4. Start the server using nodemon:
  
   nodemon

   This will start the backend server, and it will be listening for requests.

## Frontend Setup

1. Open another terminal window or tab.

2. Navigate to the frontend folder of the project using the `cd` command:

   cd Frontend


3. Install the required Node.js packages using npm:

   npm install


4. Start the frontend server:

   npm start


   This will start the frontend development server.

## Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser.

1. Open your web browser.

2. Enter the following URL in the address bar:

   http://localhost:3000


   This will open the application running on your local machine.

## Notes

- The backend server runs on port 7000 by default, and the frontend development server runs on port 3000. Ensure that these ports are available and not being used by other applications.
  
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before following these steps.

- For any issues or assistance, feel free to contact the project team.
